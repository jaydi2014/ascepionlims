<h3>Freezing bugs</h3>
<ol>
<li><em>Problem:</em> I tried to choose a template set (such as &quot;Rings&quot;)
    in the MarvinSketch applet on my webpage, but the applet does not respond.
    <p>
    <em>Solution:</em> The most likely cause is that the applet is improperly
    installed or there is a wrong ARCHIVE or CODEBASE setting in the applet tag,
    so it cannot find the chemaxon/marvin/templates directory.
    If Marvin is installed into &quot;somedirectory&quot;, then<br>
    <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" border="0">
    <tr>
    <td>use this:</td>
    <td><font COLOR="green"><code>ARCHIVE=&quot;marvin.jar&quot;
	CODEBASE=&quot;somedirectory&quot;</code></font></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>NOT this (WRONG!):</td>
    <td><font COLOR="red"><code>ARCHIVE=&quot;somedirectory/marvin.jar&quot;</code>
	</font></td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    </li>
<li><em>P:</em> I tried to do ... but the applet on my page does not
    respond, and I found a message in the Java Console:
    &quot;Cannot preload module: ...&quot;
    <p>
    <em>S:</em> The most likely cause is that the applet is improperly
    installed or there is a wrong ARCHIVE or CODEBASE setting in the applet tag,
    so it cannot find the class files in the chemaxon/marvin/modules/ directory.
    If Marvin is installed into &quot;somedirectory&quot;, then<br>
    <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" border="0">
    <tr>
    <td>use this:</td>
    <td><font COLOR="green"><code>ARCHIVE=&quot;marvin.jar&quot;
	CODEBASE=&quot;somedirectory&quot;</code></font></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>NOT this (WRONG!):</td>
    <td><font COLOR="red"><code>ARCHIVE=&quot;somedirectory/marvin.jar&quot;</code>
	</font></td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    </li>
<li><em>P:</em> When trying to print a molecule in the applet, it asks
    &quot;<strong>An applet would like to print</strong>&quot; (Yes/No)
    several times, then the applet freezes.
    <p>
    <em>S:</em> You might use a buggy Java plugin version such as 1.4.0.
    You should upgrade (or downgrade) Java.<br>
    Detailed explanation: In Java 1.4.0, one <code>Toolkit.getPrintJob()</code> call
    results in two or more confirm dialogs asking the same question, then one
    <code>PrintJob.getGraphics()</code> call results in even more questions and freezing
    when called from an unsigned applet.
    
    <p>
    </li>
<li><em>P:</em> Microsoft Internet Explorer freezes before  the applet is finished loading. 
	The following message in shown the status bar:<br>
    &quot;Opening Java class: http://my.site/mydir/chemaxon/marvin/modules/XXX.class&quot;
    <p>
    <em>S:</em> This is a bug in Microsoft's old Java 1.1 virtual machine, that
    appears under certain circumstances. As a workaround, you should
    <a HREF="../developer/viewman.html#parameters.preload">preload</a> the XXX
    module. If it still freezes but at class YYY, then you should preload
    YYY too, etc.
    See the MarvinView Example <a HREF="../../examples/applets/view/configure4.html">XYZ Animations</a>.
    <p>
    </li>
<li><em>P:</em> Netscape 6 (Sun JRE 1.3) and Mozilla freeze in Linux when an
    applet method like MSketch.getMol() is called from JavaScript.
    <p>
    <em>S:</em> This is a browser/JVM bug that occurs if an applet method is
    called from JavaScript that requests downloading a class file from the
    web (with http protocol). The workaround is to
    <a HREF="../developer/sketchman.html#parameters.preload">preload</a> the extra
    classes that will be used by the  method (see
    <a href="../../examples/applets/sketch/js_io.html">MarvinSketch Example - Import/export of built-in and
	user defined molecule formats in JavaScript</a>).
    Another solution is to upgrade Java on the user's machine. The
    problem does not exist in JRE 1.4. 
    <p>
    </li>
    <li><em>P:</em> MarvinSketch and MarvinView applications sometimes crash under Windows with Java 1.4.1_01.
    <p>
    <em>S:</em> JRE 1.4.1_01 is a buggy Java version. Many Java applications beside Marvin freeze with this version or other serious problems can occur. See on
    <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4749817.html" target="_blank">bugparade</a>.
    </li>
    <li><em>P:</em> MarvinSketch and MarvinView applications can freeze with Java 1.4.1
    <p>
    <em>S:</em> In wireframe display mode with visible "atom symbols" and 
    "all hydrogens" settings sometimes the JRE cannot draw short lines and this 
    may causes freezing. See on 
    <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4755500.html" target="_blank">Sun's Bug Parade</a>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3><a class="anchor" NAME="funcNotWork">Function does not work</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Question:</em> When I select the menu XXX or press button YYY in the
    applet, I get an error message.<br>
    When I click the &quot;Stack Trace&quot; button, it shows a
    ClassNotFoundException, ClassFormatError, IncompatibleClassChangeError
    or something similar.
    <br>
    Is it my fault (1), a Marvin installation problem (2) or a browser bug
    (3)?</li>
<li><em>Answer:</em> These are all possibilities.<br>
    <ol>
    <li>If jchem.jar, MarvinBeans.jar or some other JAR file containing
	Marvin classes is in your <code>CLASSPATH</code>, then it can
	interfere with the applet.<br>
	Please remove them from the <code>CLASSPATH</code>.
	Additional libraries such as Marvin should only be specified in a
	<em>local</em> <code>CLASSPATH</code> inside a script or a Makefile,
	but not in the <em>global</em> one that is also seen by the web browser.
	</li>
    <li>Marvin might be installed improperly, mixing the new files with an
	older installation.<br>
	If this is the case, then remove all files and reinstall it again.</li>
    <li>There might also be a cache problem with your web browser.<br>
	In Netscape, you can reload all classes with Shift+Reload. If you
	still have the bug, then try to clear the cache with Edit -&gt;
	Preferences &gt; Advanced -&gt; Cache and restart the browser.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Browser crashes</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Q:</em> My Netscape 4.x browser crashed when I closed
    a window containing frames, tables and MarvinView applets.
    Is it a Marvin bug?<p>
    <em>A:</em> No! It probably has nothing to do with
    Marvin. Pages containing frames, tables and applets may crash Netscape
    under certain circumstances. Such crashes are independent of the applet
    code.
    <p>
    </li>
<li><em>P:</em> When selecting Print from the browser's File Menu, 
    the applet area is printed in black or it doesn't appear on the paper.
    <p>
    <em>S:</em> This is a browser/JVM bug, can be found on SUN's 
    <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/" target=blank_>
    Bug Parade</a> site with  4519411 bug Id.<br>
    A fix is integrated into the 1.3.1_03, 1.4.0_01 and above update releases.
    <p>
    </li>
<li><a name="crash.mayscript"><em>P:</em></a> Netscape 6 and Netscape 7.0 (Sun JRE 1.3.1) crash 
    in Linux when a signed MarvinView applet tries to evaluate a JavaScript expression.
    <p>
    <em>S:</em> This is a browser/JVM bug that occurs if
    <code>netscape.javascript.JSObject.getWindow(applet)</code> is called from Java code.
    This bug occurs in the following buggy Java versions: 1.3.1_b24, 1.3.1_02-b02.
    They are found in Netscape 6.x and in Netscape 7.0 as built-in JVM.
    The only solution is to upgrade Java on the user's machine and 
    <a href="../developer/applets/appletfaq.html#netscape_set_java_env">set the new Java Environment to the browser</a>.
    The problem does not exist in JRE 1.3.1_01 and JRE 1.4.x.
    <p>
    </li>
    <li><em>P:</em> Under Linux, reloading an applet a lot of times can cause
    an out of memory error in the browser.
    <p>
    <em>S:</em> It is a Java bug in the Linux version of JRE 1.4.2. 
    If there is any reference to the applet in JavaScript, this JRE can not
    destroy the applet. E.g.:
    <pre>if(document.msketch != null) {
        // do someting
}</pre>
    You can find more info about this bug in 
    <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4988299"
    >Sun's Bug Parade</a>.
    To avoid this memory leak, update your JRE to 1.5.
