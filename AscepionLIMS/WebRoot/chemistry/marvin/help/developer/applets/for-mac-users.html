<a name="javaver"></a><h2>About Java Versions</h2>
<p>Each Mac OS X system contains a built-in Java (version 1.3.1 or later). 
This built-in Java is also called MRJ 3.x. Under this platform, most browsers use it
for running applets. The following links provide more info about the features of 
these Java releases:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/Java/Java50Release3RN/Introduction/chapter_1_section_1.html">Java 1.5</a> (from OS X 10.4)
<li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/ReleaseNotes/Java/Java142RN/index.html">Java 1.4.2</a>
(from OS X 10.3)
</ul></p>
<p>Note: There is a Java plugin: <a href="http://javaplugin.sourceforge.net/">JEP (Java Embedding Plugin)</a> that 
also supports 1.4.1 and above versions of Java. But it is not compatible with all browsers. It is 
still a beta quality software, and may have bugs and cause problems. 
You can download it from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaplugin/">JEP project site</a>.
To install it, follow its <a href="http://javaplugin.sourceforge.net/Readme.html">installation instructions</a>.

<a name="osx104"></a><h2>OS X 10.4 (Tiger)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Safari 3.0</h3>
This is the latest browser for Tiger. This browser is recommended for Marvin applets.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Safari 2.0</h3>
This is the default browser for Tiger. Safari uses Java 1.4.2 for 
running applets. Java - JavaScript communication is fully supported.
This browser is recommended for Marvin applets.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Firefox 1.5</h3>
It is not part of the operating system but it is downloadeable.
Like Safari, it also support Java 1.4.2 for running applets.
Although, MAYSCRIPT (calling JavaScript from Java applets) works, there are 
a couple of shortcomings in this browser.
<h4>Shortcomings</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Accessing the methods of Java applets from JavaScript is not supported.
    </li>
    <li>The applet never losts the focus.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Mozilla 1.7</h3>
Mozilla does not support Java 1.4.2, in default. It still use Java
1.3.1 for running applets.
<h4>Shortcomings</h4>
<ul>
<li>Java - JavaScript communication does not work.</li>
<li>The applet never losts the focus.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="osx103"></a><h2>OS X 10.3 (Panther)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Safari 1.2</h3>
This is the default browser in OS X 10.3. Panther supports several Java 
versions (1.3.1, 1.4.1 and 1.4.2). Safari always uses the latest Java version
 to run applets.
Java - JavaScript communication is supported (if Java 1.4.2 is installed).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Netscape 7.1 / Mozilla 1.4 and above</h3>
These browsers contains a built-in Java Plugin that can automatically detect
the built-in Java of OS X (only Java 1.3.1) for running applets.
<h4>Shortcomings (with built-in Plugin)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Java - JavaScript communication does not work.</li>
    <li>Java 1.4.1 and above Java versions are not supported.</li>
</ul>
To run applets with Java 1.4.2, install 
<a href="http://javaplugin.sourceforge.net/">JEP (Java Embedding Plugin)</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Netscape 6.2.1 - 7.0.2</h3>
The Netscape 6 family applies Apple's Java 1.3.1 which is built into OS X
for running applets. Although the methods of Java applets are available from
JavaScript in these browser they also has got a few shorcomings.
<h4>Shortcoming</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Java 1.4.1 and above version is not supported.</li>
    <li>Calling JavaScript from Java (MAYSCRIPT) does not work.</li>
    <li>Focus lost bug: the browser can crash if the applet is active and 
    you click somewhere (outside of the applet area).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
<a name="installCarbonPlugin"></a>
If the browser requests a plugin for the applet, install MRJ Carbon Plugin:
<ul>
    <li>Download 
        <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/pcbeard/MRJPlugin/MRJPluginCarbon-1.0.1.sit">MRJ Carbon Plugin</a>.</li>
    <li>Install it by double clicking on the downloaded archive file. If the 
        archive is not extracted automatically, start the 
        <code>Stuffit Expander</code> and extract the archive manually.</li>
    <li>Move the <code>MRJPluginCarbon</code> file from the created 
        <code>MRJPluginCarbon-1.0</code> directory into 
        <code>Library/Internet Plug-Ins</code> folder.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Internet Explorer 5.x</h3>
Although Internet Explorer is still part of the operating system but we do
not recommend it because of the following shortcomings.
<h4>Shortcomings</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Only Java 1.3.1 is supported for running applets.</li>
    <li>Java - JavaScript communication does not work.</li>   
</ul>
