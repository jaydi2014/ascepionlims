<h1>Markush Enumeration Plugin</h1>

A Markush structure is a description of a compound class by generic notations,
primarily used in patent claims and the description of combinatorial libraries.
The library of a Markush structure is the total set of specific molecules that
are described by the Markush structure. 
<p>
The Markush enumeration plugin can be used to generate a whole or a subset of
the library of a generic Markush structure. It is also capable of calculating
the total number of specific structures present in a Markush library. The plugin
is accessible from the Marvin GUI (Tools->Markush Enumeration), through the
<a href="http://www.chemaxon.com/marvin/doc/user/calc.html">cxcalc
    command-line program</a> (See <a 
        href="../applications/cxcalc-calculations.html#Enumerations">this
    link</a> for the detailed usage of the plugin in command line.), via 
    API 
    and in the <a href="http://www.chemaxon.com/jchem/doc/user/EvaluatorTables.html#enumerationcount">

<h3>Markush features</h3>
Currently, the Markush enumeration plugin supports the following features that describe
mostly Markush structures in combinatorial libraries:

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" id="grid">
    <tr><th align=center>Name</th>
        <th align=center>Description</th>
        <th align=center>Example</th>
        <th align=center>Example Markush library member</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td align=center>R-groups</td>
        <td align=left>R-groups (also referred to as "substituent variation")
            are the most widely known Markush generic features. The variable
            part of the structure is denoted by an R-atom (eg. R1), and the
            definitions are given separately. In each definition the connection
            points must be defined to show where the bonds of the R-atom are
            linked. R-atoms can appear in both rings and chains and can have
            up to two attachments points. The same R-atom can appear multiple
            times, and the different occurrences are handled as different cases.
            (So they can be substituted with different definitions.) R-group
            nesting in R-group definitions is allowed to any depth, but
            without recursion. (An R-group definition cannot use the
            R-atom it is defining, not even through the use of other
            embedding R-atom(s).) In Marvin and the plugin,
            R-groups up to number R32767 can be used.</td>

        <td align=center><img src="images/markush05.png" width="107" height="151"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td align=center>Atom lists</td>
        <td align=left>Atom lists are another example of substituent variation.
            They define lists of atom types at a given position. There is no
            restriction for the length of the list and for bond count of atom
            lists.

    </tr>
    <tr><td align=center>Bond lists</td>
        <td align=left>The following bond lists (generic bond types) are
            supported by the plugin: single or double, any(single, double or
            triple), single or aromatic, double or aromatic.</td>
        <td align=center><img src="images/markush03.png" width="118" height="51"></td>
        <td align=center><img src="images/markush07.png" width="126" height="48"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td align=center>Link nodes</td>
        <td align=left>Link nodes are atoms that may repeat between two of
            their designated bonds (called outer bonds, denoted by brackets).
            All other substituents (if exist) repeat together with the atom.
            In the results, the new bonds between the repeating atoms will have
            the bond type of the lower order outer bond. 
        </td>
        <td align=center><img src="images/markush04.png" width="230" height="105"></td>
        <td align=center><img src="images/markush08.png" width="234" height="101"></td>
    </tr>
        <tr><td align=center>Position variation bonds</td>
            <td align=left>Position variation bonds are bonds attached to variable atoms at one or both end positions.
	        The set of variable atoms is drawn as a multicenter group. A position variation bond connects
		one atom from one end position to one atom from the other end position. If the end position is a single atom
		then the bond is attached to this atom, if the end position is a multicenter group then the bond is attached 
		to an arbitrary member of the group. 
		<p><b>Limitations:</b> 
		<p>
		<ul>
		<li>Substructure search is not yet prepared to handle the case when
		both end positions are multicenter groups.</li>
		<li>A multicenter end position is not allowed to contain R-atoms.</li>
		<li>A multicenter end position is not allowed to contain another position variation bond
		(ie, position variation bonds cannot be nested).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		If a link node is a member of a multicenter group then the group will 
		include the repeated atoms as well in case when the original multicenter group contains no more atoms from the
		link fragment, otherwise the position variation bond is part of the link fragment and repeated together with the
		link node. Although an R-atom is not allowed to take part in position variation, 
		it can be the single-atom end position of a position variation bond, in which case its attachment point 
		is connected to the bond.

<h3>Functionality of the plugin</h3>
The plugin allows the following functionality. Examples are given using Marvin
GUI.
<dl>
<dt><b>Sequential enumeration</b></dt> <dd>Enumerates members of the Markush
    library in a sequential manner (by substituting the first definition of
    the first variable, etc). The results are specific structures. The plugin
    user interface allows the enumeration of all library members, or a specified
    number.
    <p>
    <img src="images/markush09.png" align="middle" width="820" height="870">
</dd>
<dt><b>Random enumeration</b></dt> <dd>This mode generates a random subset of the
    Markush library to give a quick sampling. It is especially helpful for huge
    libraries, where full enumeration is impossible. In random mode variable
    parts are chosen randomly, and the substitution probability of each
    definition is proportionate with the fragment library size that the given
    definition generates. This ensures the generation of a representative
    random subset over the Markush library space.
    <p>
    <img src="images/markush10.png" align="middle" width="820" height="870">
</dd>
<dt><b>Calculate library size</b></dt> <dd>The size of the Markush
    library can be calculated by arbitrary precision. On the user interface,
    the exact value is displayed until 20 digits, above that only the magnitude
    is shown (for example, 10^28). The calculated number is the size of the
    whole library, and does not consider the valence check filter. (See below.)
    <p>
    <img src="images/markush11.png" align="middle" width="820" height="870">
</dd>
<dt><b>Selected part enumeration</b></dt> <dd>If part of the Markush structure is
    selected, only the generic features in the selected part are considered for
    enumeration/calculation. This allows focusing on a particular area of the
    Markush structure. Enumeration of selected parts only may result in
    generating (more specific) Markush structures.
    <p>
    <img src="images/markush12.png" align="middle" width="820" height="870">
</dd>
<dt><b>Valence filter</b></dt> <dd>If the Markush structure is not properly
    (or too generally) formulated, it is possible that it describes structures
    with valence errors. In this case, the valence filter setting is useful to
    filter out the offending result structures. The default value is on.
    <p>
    <img src="images/markush13.png" align="middle" width="930" height="975">
</dd>
</dl>
<dt><b>Scaffold alignment and coloring</b></dt> <dd>Coloring the scaffold 
(part of the structure containg no Markush features) and/or the R-groups in
enumerated structures can help visual recognition of parts of the molecules. 
Differentiation of the structures is aided by alignment of all structures to 
the original scaffold. These options are available in sequential and random enumeration.
